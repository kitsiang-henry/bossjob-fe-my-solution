# Bossjob Frontend Test

## Instruction
#### Please implement the job list page as per design (job-list-design.jpg). <br/>

Use this git repository as a starter kit. This has been created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 

Node Version: v16.0.0

**UI library is strongly discouraged**.

The app should have/be able to do the following:
1. Listing of the first 12 jobs
2. Able to search for job by title or company name
3. Clicking on each job navigates user to `/job/{job-title}` page (You may leave the UI of this page blank).
4. Fetch data using redux-saga
5. Pagination 

*Additional points for the following implementations:* 
- Typescript 
- File/code structures
- Anything you would like to showcase, impress us with your skills :) 

<br/>
